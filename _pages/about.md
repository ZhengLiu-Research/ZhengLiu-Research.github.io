Zheng Liu holds a B.S. in Electronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, an M.S. from UCLA, and a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Princeton University. From 2015 to 2018, he served as a Senior Design Engineer at Skyworks Solutions Inc., California, where he played a pivotal role in RF power amplifier and front-end module design, contributing to the successful shipment of over 40 million units worldwide. He also worked with Apple on mmWave beamformer design and is currently a researcher at Kilby Research Labs, Texas Instruments, focusing on GaN power amplifier modules and mmWave highly stable clock systems.

Dr. Liuâ€™s research expertise includes mm-wave and sub-THz transmiters/power amplifiers, wideband phased array systems, and AI enabled RFIC design methodology. His contributions to the MTT-S field have been recognized with several prestigious awards, including the **Bede Liu Best Ph.D. Dissertation Award** from Princeton University in 2023, the **IEEE IMS 2022 Advanced Practice Paper Award** (First Author), the **IEEE MTT-S Microwave Fellowship** in 2021, and the **Analog Devices Outstanding Student Designer Award** in 2021. Additionally, he has received **three IEEE IMS Best Student Paper Awards**, including two as first author in IMS 2021 and one as co-author in IMS 2020.

Dr. Liu is an affiliate member of the MTT-S Technical Committee on Microwave and mmWave Integrated Circuits (TC-14), a Technical Program Committe (TPRC) member of IEEE IMS 2025,  and actively serves as a reviewer for leading journals such as IEEE JSSC, TMTT, TCAS-I etc.
