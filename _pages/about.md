Zheng Liu received his B.S. in Electronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, a M.S. in Electrical Engineering from UCLA, and a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Princeton University. He previously worked as a Senior Design Engineer at Skyworks Solutions, where his RF power amplifier and front-end module designs enabled the shipment of more than 40 million units in commercial wireless products. He later collaborated with Apple on advanced mmWave beamforming ICs. From 2023 to 2025, he is a researcher at Texas Instruments’ Kilby Labs, leading developments in GaN power amplifier modules for emerging 6G wireless systems and ultra-stable sub-THz clock technologies.

Dr. Liu’s research expertise includes AI-enabled RF integrated circuit design methodology, wideband phased array system architecture and RF to mmWave power amplifiers and transceivers. His contributions to the microwave and solid-state circuits field have been recognized with several prestigious awards, including the **Bede Liu Best Ph.D. Dissertation Award** from Princeton University in 2023, the **IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits (JSSC) Best Paper Award** 2023, the **IEEE International Microwave Symposium (IMS) 2022 Advanced Practice Paper Award** (First Author), the **IEEE MTT-S Microwave Fellowship** in 2021, and the **Analog Devices Outstanding Student Designer Award** in 2021. Additionally, he has received **three IEEE IMS Best Student Paper Awards**, including two as first author in IMS 2021 and one as co-author in IMS 2020.

Dr. Liu is a member of the MTT-S Technical Committee on Microwave and mmWave Integrated Circuits (TC-14), a Technical Program Committe (TPC) member of IEEE IMS 2025 and IMS 2026, and actively serves as a reviewer for leading journals such as IEEE JSSC, TMTT, TCAS-I etc.
