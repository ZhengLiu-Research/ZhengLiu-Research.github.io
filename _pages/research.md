  Our society is at an inflection point of technological transformation, driven by the next generation of wireless chip-
scale systems. Advances in radio-frequency (RF), millimeter-wave (mmWave), and sub-terahertz (THz) integrated cir-
cuits and systems have already enabled crucial applications, including 5G communication, autonomous driving radar,
gesture recognition etc. Today’s RF/mmWave systems are extremely complex; however, design productivity has not
kept pace with system complexity, and the full potential of these systems remains unrealized due to three major chal-
lenges within the ecosystem: 1) In terms of design methdologies, there exists no generalized approach to efficiently
synthesis of such complex high-frequency circuits. The use of templated, narrow design spaces limits performance po-
tential, while the time-intensive, human-guided design process extends semiconductor development cycles significantly.
2) In terms of system architectures, the current approach to multi-antenna wireless interfaces have remained largely
unchanged for two decades, relying on frequency-static front-ends with narrow bandwidth and application-specific de-
signs, limiting versatility and universality. 3) In terms of circuits, mainstream digital-compatible, low-cost silicon-
based transistors are increasingly unable to meet the heterogeneous demands of high-frequency performance includ-
ing power, efficiency, bandwidth, noise etc. 

  Addressing the multi-tiered challenges of future intelligent wireless chip-scale systems—from MHz to THz, and from communication to sensing—requires a transformative co-design approach,
which integrates algorithms, architectures, and circuits to achieve better performance and design productivity across
diverse applications. The approach is expected to leverage AI to discover new design spaces and accelerate design
cycles; to develop universal system architectures adaptable to diverse applications and spectrum; and to enhance cir-
cuits and devices through beyond-silicon materials to achieve unprecedented performance. Therefore, my research vision
is founded on these three pillars: **1) Smarter wireless chip design through AI/ML-driven methodologies; 2) Greater wireless system universality through novel phased array architectures; 3) Superior circuits and electromagnetics through advanced materials and co-design**.
